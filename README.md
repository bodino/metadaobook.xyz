# Meta-DAO Book Project

Welcome to the `metadaoxyz` repository! This project is dedicated for the Meta-DAO Book. 

## Project Structure

- `image_gen_code/`: Contains code used to generate images for the book. This includes scripts for procedural generation, AI-based image creation, or any other method used to create the visuals.
- `src/`: The source code for the SvelteKit application. It includes all the Svelte components, libraries, and assets required to run the web application.
- `static/`: Hosts all the final images displayed on the site. These images are referenced directly by the SvelteKit app for display.
